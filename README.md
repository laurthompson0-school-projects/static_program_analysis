# Static Program Analysis

**Course:** CS 399, Directed Readings

**Languages/Frameworks:** Datalog, Racket

**Project Description:**  
This project contains some of the code and documentation that I created during an
independent study and research course in which I learned about using the logic
programming language Datalog for use with static program analysis. This research
was conducted under the mentorship of Thomas Gilray, Ph. D. from the HARP lab
at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. This repo contains a parser
for a simple functional programming language, written in Racket, and
some basic program analysis of the reachability of data for programs
in this simple language, written in Datalog.

Note: This project is assosciated with the paper [Datalog_for_static_program_analysis.pdf](https://github.com/laurthompson0/papers/blob/main/Datalog_for_static_program_analysis.pdf)
